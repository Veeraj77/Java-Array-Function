# Java Array Functions Project

This project demonstrates array operations such as separating even and odd numbers and finding the minimum difference between consecutive numbers.

## Files Overview

- **Main.java**: Entry point of the program that initializes input handling and calls functions.
- **UserInput.java**: Handles user input and returns an integer array.
- **ArrayFunction.java**: Implements array-related operations.

## Features and Functions

### `UserInput.java`
- `arrayInput()`: Reads 5 integer inputs from the user and returns them as an array.

### `ArrayFunction.java`
- `display(ArrayList<Integer> array)`: Prints the contents of an array.
- `oddEven(int[] array)`: Separates even and odd numbers from the given array and displays them.
- `findMinDifference(int[] array)`: Finds and returns the smallest difference between consecutive numbers in the array.
